# OpenGL-Game

This program is a game based on something i started in SDL2. This was in 2D so had to start from scratch, using some ideas from the original.

Most this program is referenced from series of tutorials found here http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/ 
many of the files are exact copies including source files - controls.cpp, objloader.cpp, shader.cpp, text2D.cpp, texture.cpp, vbdoindexer.cpp,
and header files - controls.hpp, objloader.hpp, shader.hpp, text2D.hpp, texture.hpp, vboindexer.hpp 
and shader files - StandardShading.fragmentshader, StandardShading.vertexshader, TextVertexShader.fragmentshader and TextVertexShader.vertexshader.

The main Source.cpp is also based on the tutorials but heavily modifed by me. The main idea was to create a simple scrolling shooter but in 3D abd using simple cubes for the retro look/design.
